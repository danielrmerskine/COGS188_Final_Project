    "You have the choice of doing either (1) an AI solve a problem style project or (2) run a Special Topics class on a topic of your choice.  If you want to do (2) you should fill out the _other_ proposal for that. This is the proposal description for (1).\n",
    "\n",
    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",
    "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like 8-Queens or a small Traveling Salesman Problem or similar\n",
    "- If its the kind of problem (e.g., RL) that interacts with a simulator or live task, then the problem will have a reasonably complex action space. For instance, a wupus world kind of thing with a 9x9 grid is definitely too small.  A simulated mountain car with a less complex 2-d road and simplified dynamics seems like a fairly low achievement level.  A more complex 3-d mountain car simulation with large extent and realistic dynamics, sure sounds great!\n",
    "- If its the kind of problem that uses a dataset, then the dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training an unsupervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",
    "- The project must include some elements we talked about in the course\n",
    "- The project will include a model selection and/or feature selection component where you will be looking for the best setup to maximize the performance of your AI system. Generally RL tasks may require a huge amount of training, so extensive grid search is unlikely to be possible. However expoloring a few reasonable hyper-parameters may still be possible. \n",
    "- You will evaluate the performance of your AI system using more than one appropriate metric\n",
    "- You will be writing a report describing and discussing these accomplishments\n",

    "# Abstract \n",
    "Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers among men and a leading cause of cancer-related deaths; Therefore, early and accurate detection is critical for improving patient outcomes, which is why in this project, we aim to develop a neural network model to predict prostate cancer diagnosis based on patient medical history, lifestyle factors, and clinical test results. We will use a dataset containing 27,945 observations and 30 variables, including PSA levels, family history, biopsy results, and other relevant health metrics. Our approach will involve training a deep learning classifier to distinguish between benign and malignant cases. Model performance will be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure reliable and clinically meaningful predictions. Additionally, we will explore explainability methods to provide insights into key factors influencing the model’s decisions. Our goal is to create a robust, data-driven diagnostic tool that could assist healthcare professionals in improving prostate cancer detection as well as in treatment planning."

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Prostate cancer is the second most common type of cancer to develop and the second leading cause of cancer death in men in the United States. Some of the methods of diagnosis for prostate cancer like a digital rectal exam or prostate biopsy are quite invasive and can be subject to human error. Neural networks give us the opportunity to use a more data-driven approach by analyzing medical and family history. Here are some examples of past work that researchers have done to classify cases of prostate cancer as benign or malignant, which greatly helps the ability of healthcare professionals to detect the cancer early and decide possible treatment strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first resource<a name=”note1”></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#note1) I found related to this project had a very method of predicting whether a patient’s prostate cancer was benign or malignant. Roffman and his fellow researchers used a multiparameterized neural network that uses patient health information to predict the risk of prostate cancer. The team concluded that their neural network demonstrated high specificity and low sensitivity so it could potentially be used as a non-invasive method for cancer risk assessment. We hope to create more relevant neural network compared to Roffman and his team due to our dataset being much more up to date (Roffman’s dataset contained data from 1997 to 2015 and ours is from 2019 to 2024) and our dataset has a much higher rate of malignant tumors (Roffman’s dataset contained about 1.6% malignant tumors and ours has 30% malignant tumors). We hope to expand on Roffman and his team’s research.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next resource<a name=”note2”></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#note2) I found related to this project is similar to the previous project except Esteban and his team use far more modeling techniques (classification tree, random first, neural networks, and more) compared to Roffman. Their dataset is based on 4799 patients in Catalonia, Spain, which is less than one twentieth of the size of Rothman’s dataset: this is slightly concerning. Esteban and his team used a 80-20% training and validation split. The modeling technique with the best performance was XGBoost. The most influential parameters on the result were digital rectal examination and family history, which makes sense logically.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third resource we explored <a name=”note3”></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#note3) was a study where Talaat and her team used a convolutional neural network (ResNet50) with a large dataset of annotated medical images for early detection of prostate cancer. Talaat and her team’s model achieved an accuracy rate of 95.24%. The study also discussed the ethical implications of balancing overdiagnosis and early detection and how it is still debated. \n",
    "\n",
    "The fourth resource<a name=”note4”></a>[<sup>[4]</sup>](#note4) we dove into reviewed the current landscape of using AI-powered diagnostic tools to help give clinicians valuable insights from medical data that could be used to improve patient outcomes. Although the authors of this research did not create any machine learning models like the previously mentioned studies, they gave us more knowledge as to what we can include in the ethics and privacy sections of our project. Agrawal concluded that although there is a bright future for these AI-powered tools, there are still regulatory hurdles and ethical considerations that we must consider as a society.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fifth resource<a name=”note5”></a>[<sup>[5]</sup>](#note5) is another review that did not include the creation of a machine learning model but instead gave us some insights as to the current state of using machine learning models in prostate cancer diagnosis. Olabanjo and his team found that the United States has the most research on prostate cancer diagnosis with machine learning, that magnetic resonance images are the most often used dataset when using datasets of images, and that the most common method of diagnosing prostate cancer is transfer learning. Four of the six researchers on Olabanjo’s team were from Nigeria and discussed how there is a higher prevalence and mortality rate of prostate cancer in developing countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final resource<a name=”note6”></a>[<sup>[6]</sup>](#note6) is yet another review performed by medical doctors and does not include any computer scientist creating machine learning models. Riaz and his team explored the role of AI in many different stages of prostate cancer medical treatment: prostate cancer drug discovery, clinical trials, and clinical practice guidelines. The authors also discussed how human-AI collaboration will become more and more symbiotic in cancer care and will be used to augment and enhance human decision making with accurate and real-time data. Human oversight and domain expertise was discussed to be hugely important in the discussion of using AI implementation for prostate cancer care. This review will further help us write the ethics and privacy section of our project due to the standards and ethical frameworks explored by Raiz and his team.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, we explored three studies that used AI implementations to detect prostate cancer in patients around the world and three reviews that will help our team consider the ethical concerns of allowing machine learning models to make decisions affecting the human body. Daniel Erskine’s (me) father is a radiologist and we asked him to explain some of the intricacies of these medical procedures so we gained more knowledge on the topic.\n",

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to develop a more reliable, data-driven approach for early prostate cancer detection based on non-invasive patient data, including medical history, lifestyle factors, and clinical test results.\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim to achieve this goal by building a machine learning model that can predict whether a patient’s prostate cancer is benign or malignant using a neural network. The problem is well-defined as a binary classification task, where the model assigns each patient to one of two classes based on input features. It is quantifiable, as we can use structured patient data (e.g., PSA levels, biopsy results, genetic risk factors) to make predictions. The problem is measurable through evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score ensuring clinical relevance. Lastly, the problem is replicable since prostate cancer diagnosis is a recurring medical challenge, and our methodology can be applied to other similar datasets for further validation and improvement."

    "As stated by the prompt for this section, almost every ML project has ethical implications. A ML project in the healthcare industry is certain to have ethical implications \n",
    "\n",
    "The primary ethical issue that arises with our project about the dataset itself and the concept of patient data confidentiality. Patient data confidentially means that a patient's health information cannot be used or shared without your written consent, unless certain laws allow it. Although our dataset does not elaborate on the origin of their data besides stating that it is webscraper from “12 Health data Websites,” I believe that our data is ethically sourced due to the fact that these health data websites would certainly be shut down and sued if found exposing patient’s healthcare data without consent. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) both help protect our healthcare data from being stolen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another ethical consideration is potential bias in the dataset. If the dataset that we use to train our neural network is disproportionately represented by people from specific demographic groups, the neural network may produce results that misdiagnose groups of people that are not represented correctly in the dataset. We must ensure that the dataset we use is diverse so that our model is fair and accurate. Although we do not have an ethnicity parameter for our dataset, we do have an “Race_African_Ancestry” parameter which 20% of our dataset has as true. This leads me to believe that we will not have an issue of underrepresentation due to 13.7% of the population that our dataset was drawn from (the United States) being of African ancestry. Olabanjo and his team discussed the fact that developing countries have a higher prevalence and mortality rate of prostate cancer, even if the work done in this project is based on a dataset from the United States population, hopefully the results can be used to reduce the amount of prostate cancer around the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over-reliance on AI models in medical decision making is another risk we must consider. Neural networks, such as the one we propose to make, should be used to assist in diagnosis but not be used as a replacement. Physicians will need to remain present and confirm the results given by a machine learning model. AI models may not have all the contextual information needed to give a correct diagnosis. As a society, we need to use the outputs of these large language models as recommendations that can be used to assist medical professions in their work, but not be used to replace them completely.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last ethical consideration we have is the idea of informed consent. From student athletes  getting a routine check up to elderly men getting a digital rectal exam for prostate cancer, patients should be aware of how and when their healthcare data is being used. Patients should be given the option to keep their data private. This consideration is more important for the creator of the dataset we are using, but we believed that we should explore it nonetheless.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there are any future ethical problems caused by neural networks in healthcare, as a society, we need to be ready to recognize when this happens and how to deal with it. We imagine that in the future, healthcare companies will employ huge numbers of data scientists for this exact purpose. \n"
